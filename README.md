A statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate an assumption about a population parameter

*  **The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze hypothesis tests.

*  **The goal** is to apply descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing in Python.

## **Steps for conducting a hypothesis test:**

*  State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis

*  Choose a signficance level

*  Find the p-value

*  Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis

### **1. Null hypothesis:** 

There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).

### **2. Alternative hypothesis:** 

There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).

### **3. Significance level:** 

The threshold at which a result is considered statistically significant		

### **4. P-value:** 

The probability of observing results as or more extreme than those observed when the null hypothesis is true

### **5. Reject or Fail to reject the null hypothesis:**
